        <p class="box">How’s business? Boomin. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. They don’t want us to eat. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Fan luv. Congratulations, you played yourself. Special cloth alert. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. You smart, you loyal, you a genius.</p>
        <p class="box">Lion! Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Don’t ever play yourself. They don’t want us to eat. Fan luv. Lion! The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Eliptical talk.</p>
        <p class="box">Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Eliptical talk. Bless up. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Wraith talk. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Lion! We the best. Cloth talk. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.</p>
